Feature engineering:
Different types of savanna, shrublands, and forests are given individually in the original land cover dataset. We
merged them into ‘savanna’, ‘forest’ and ‘shrubland’
Instead of the latitude, we took the absolute latitude, since radiation and temperature decrease when moving away
from the equator regardless in which direction

Final predicor list:
Climatic zone
Absolute latitude
Altitude
Relative altitude

Savannas in 25 km area
Grasslands in 25 km area
Permanent wetlands in 25 km area
Croplands in 25 km area
Rice production
NOx emissions
NO2column
Population density
Maximum population density in 5 km area

Nightlight 1 km
Nightlight in 5 km area
Maximum nightlight in 25 km area


Predictors we did not use because they favoured overfitting:
Urban And Built-Up in 25 km area
Cropland / Natural vegetation mosaic in 25 km area
Snow and ice in 25 km area
Barren or sparsely vegetated in 25 km area
Wheat production
